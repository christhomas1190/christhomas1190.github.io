            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p >I'm Christian Thomas, a teacher, coach, and aspiring web developer. I've dedicated seven years to teaching at Lindenwold Middle School, collaborating with eight fellow physical education teachers in that time. My college background is in education.
                However, over the last year and a half, inspired by discussions with friends who work within tech, I've developed a keen interest in transitioning to a career as a web developer. In August 2022, I embarked on the journey of self-learning web development. Since completing my boot camp, I honed my skills through platforms like LeetCode and CodeWars, preparing for a career shift into web development. Technology and problem-solving have always been my passions, and I'm eager for a new challenge.
                Alongside my professional pursuits, I'm committed to learning Spanish, maintaining an impressive <span id="spanishStreak"></span> streak on Duolingo as of now.</p>

        <section id="experiences" class="hoverable">
            <h4>Professional Experiences</h4>
            <p >In my capacity as a physical education teacher, I successfully navigated a challenging and diverse environment by promoting collaboration to address educational challenges. Simultaneously, coaching in three sports honed my leadership and teamwork skills, providing a valuable foundation for the dynamic world of web development.<br>
                Beyond the classroom, my experiences underscore effective communication, strategic planning, and a steadfast commitment to well-rounded development â€“ qualities directly applicable to seamless collaboration within a team of web developers. I bring not only technical expertise but also a collaborative spirit and a genuine passion for achieving collective goals in the fast-paced field of technology.</p>
